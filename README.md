Riddle found on [Mind Your Decisions blog.](https://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2018/05/03/can-you-solve-the-knight-on-a-chessboard-riddle-math-olympiad-problem/)

 Alice and Bob are playing a game using a chess board. Alice starts by placing a knight on the board. Then they take turns moving the knight to a new square (one it has not been on before). Standard chess rules apply: the knight can only move in an “L” shape, 2 squares in one direction and one square to the side.

The first player who cannot move the knight to a new square loses the game. Who wins if both players play optimally, and what is the winning strategy?
